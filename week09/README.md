# Week 9 Assignment
## Parsing Temperature Data from URL and Timed Input to PostgreSQL

In this week's assignment, students are able to put their skills to the test as we execute methods that have been experienced in AA data assignments. We have setup a temperature sensor that is constantly relaying temperature and other data to a url through an API. The url is requested in the code, the data is parsed and split into different categories, and then the information is populated in an SQL database. The first step is to create a new database and table in SQL (which we have experience with in a previous assignment). See the code below:
